\section{Description of the learning algorithm}

\section{Training analysis}

The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen
hyperparameters.
It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able
to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13.
The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
